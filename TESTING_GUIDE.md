## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still Getting Infinite Loop

**Check Console For:**
```
🔄 Auth state changed: (repeating endlessly)
```

**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser storage:
   ```javascript
   // In console:
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

2. Sign out completely:
   ```javascript
   // In console:
   firebase.auth().signOut();
   ```

3. Check for multiple `onAuthStateChanged` listeners:
   - Should only see "Setting up auth state listener" ONCE

---

### Problem: "User profile not found" Error

**Solutions:**
1. Deploy Firestore rules:
   ```powershell
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. Check Firestore Console:
   - Database created?
   - Rules deployed?
   - Collection "users" exists?

---

### Problem: Email Verification Loop

**Solutions:**
1. Verify your email first
2. Or temporarily disable check (see LOGIN_LOOP_FIX.md)
3. Check if verification email was sent

---
